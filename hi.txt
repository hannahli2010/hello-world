I have often dreamed of a far off place. Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me. Where the crowds would cheer just to see my face and a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be. I'll be there someday, I can go the distance. I will find my way if I can be strong. I know every mile, will be worth my while. When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong.

THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN!
Down…
	Down…
		Down…
Freedom for America, freedom for France!
Down…
	Down…
		Down…
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Down…
	Down…
		Down…

We've digged through the dump looking for treasures unfound
As you softly sing the sweetest delightful song.
We've built the titanium space shuttle out of hope,
So one day the world can be saved by this sound.
