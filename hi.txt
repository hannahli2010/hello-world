I have often dreamed of a far off place. Where a hero's welcome would be waiting for me. Where the crowds would cheer just to see my face and a voice keeps saying this is where I'm meant to be. I'll be there someday, I can go the distance. I will find my way if I can be strong. I know every mile, will be worth my while. When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong.

THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN!
Down…
	Down…
		Down…

Let’s take a break. Please.
